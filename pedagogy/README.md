#### 1. Focus Area : Experimentation and data analysis
The user will able to understand the shaft and hole , and also able to understand through hit and trail method by entering the value in simulator.

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to identify the different parts of the components: | Remembering|Recall
2.| User will be able to compare different types of fits in an assembly: | Understanding  |Compare
3.| User will be able to create the assembly for any given data:| apply | develop
4.|User will able to calculate the numerical parameter value of any given assembly: | Apply | Solve

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to identify the different parts of the components. | Simulator show an assembly | Where is shaft? <br> Where is hole? <br> What is the deviation given in question?
2.| User will be able to compare different types of fits in an assembly | Based on user input simulator will show different types of assembly | Which type of fit the simulator is showing? 
3.| User will be able to create the assembly for any given data. | Simulator will create new assemblies based on user input | Create an assembly with clearance fit?<br> Create an assembly with Interference fit? <br> Create an assembly with Transition fit? <br>Design a assembly based on tolerance?
4.| User will able to calculate the numerical parameter value of any given assembly | Based on input user will able to calculate others value in simulators | Find the tolerance zone? <br>Find minimum and maximum clearance?

 <u> You can add additional TASKS & Assessment Questions <u>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| User will choose which type of data he wants to provide | Simulator will change the way of taking inputs as per user | To widen up the input methods
2.|User will now provide information of the given assembly | Simulator will understand the values and calculate the results | Results will be shows
3.| User will press on graphical representaiton tab | Simulator will create a assembly with the help of calculated results | For pictorial presentation
